	 <h1>History of Blogs</h1>
  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a wearable   
 computer with head-up display   
 appeared on February 22, 1995</p>
  <p>The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997. The short form, "blog", is attributed to Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word "weblog" into the phrase "we blog" in his blog's sidebar around April or May 1999</p>
  <p>Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with their product, Pyra Labs Blogger. This significantly contributed to the popularization of the terms "blog" and "blogger"</p>
